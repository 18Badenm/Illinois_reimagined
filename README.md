# Illinois_reimagined
An interface where students can submit homework and give feedback

start with log in page.

If the users are students they will have a feature, which they can view assignments and feedback. 
Students can also work on assignments in the application and submit them using a text editor 

On the teacher side when they login, they can see the homework submission from the students
 and they can grade and give a feedback using the same text editor used for the students
